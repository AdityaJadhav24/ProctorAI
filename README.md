# ProctorAI
ProctorAI is a machine learning-based exam proctoring system using TensorFlow. It monitors students during online exams, detecting suspicious activities like multiple faces, mobile phones, and browser/tab switching. The system locks the browser, logs events, and provides teachers with real-time insights and detailed logs for exam integrity.

## üöÄ Features

- **Real-Time Monitoring**: Uses machine learning models for continuous monitoring during online exams.
- **Face Detection**: Detects faces to ensure the student is present throughout the exam.
- **Suspicious Behavior Detection**: Identifies multiple people in the frame, unauthorized devices (e.g., mobile phones), or any abnormal activity.
- **Tab-Switching Detection**: Logs attempts to switch tabs or exit the exam page.
- **Teacher Dashboard**: Teachers can create and manage exam rooms, track student progress, and view detailed activity logs.
- **Secure Exam Environment**: Locks the browser to prevent cheating and ensures that the student cannot access any external resources during the exam.
